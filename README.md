# Project-ArvatoCapstone

1. Libraries used:
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using any Python 3 version.

2. Files in the repository with a small description of each:
There is one notebook in this repository in which all neccessary steps are performed. Additionally, I uploaded the two Excel files that have been provided. The original datasets and some pickle-files that I have created during the analysis are too large and cannot be uploaded.

3. Summary of the results of the analysis:
The main findings of the analysis can be found at the blog post at: https://medium.com/@flo-wimmer/customer-segmentation-report-for-arvato-financial-solutions-6d13e344ac6d
